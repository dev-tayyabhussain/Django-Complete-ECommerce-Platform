# E-Commerce DevOps Proof of Concept

A comprehensive proof-of-concept e-commerce application demonstrating modern DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and automated deployment.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project implements a **Django MVT (Model-View-Template)** architecture with comprehensive DevOps practices:

- **Django Application**: E-commerce store with product management
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and production environments
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests integrated into CI/CD workflow
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring setup
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment to free hosting services

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. **Code Quality**: Runs linting and code formatting
2. **Testing**: Executes unit tests with coverage reporting
3. **Security**: Scans for vulnerabilities
4. **Containerization**: Builds Docker images
5. **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to staging/production

## 🐳 Containerization

- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for production optimization
- **docker-compose.yml**: Development environment with database
- **Production-ready**: Optimized for deployment

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for production
- **Health Checks**: Application health monitoring
- **Metrics**: Basic performance metrics collection

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Model and view testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Test Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting
- **CI Integration**: Tests run on every commit

## 🌐 Deployment

### Free Hosting Options
- **Render.com**: Easy deployment with automatic scaling
- **Railway**: Simple container deployment
- **PythonAnywhere**: Python-focused hosting

### Deployment Strategy
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime updates
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Environment Management**: Separate staging and production
